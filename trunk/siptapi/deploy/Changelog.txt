SIPTAPI Changelog

v. 0.2.10
- added workaround for alternative configuration with XLite/Bria
- enhanced documentation

v. 0.2.9
- added file which describes a workaround for TAPI problems in Outlook 2007/2010
- added "reverse-mode": normally SIPTAPI calls the user's phone and then refers 
  it to the real target. In reverse mode SIPTAPI will call directly the target, 
  and once the target answers, it gets refered to the user's phone.
  Note: In reverse mode you wont get any audible call progress indication (e.g. ringback, busy tone ...)
- location of SIPTAPI settings changed (should work better with security features of Vista and Windows 7)
  old location: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Software\enum.at\SipTapi
  new location: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Telephony\SipTapiSF
- Sourceforge code repository migrated from CVS to SVN
