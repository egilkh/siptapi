A short SIPTAPI installation tutorial .....

There are 2 versions available: Release and Debug. From functionality point 
of view they are ocmpletely identical, except that the Debug version writes
log messages to the file c:\siptapi_0.2.log and sends kernel log messages 
which can be read for eaxmple with DebugView)

If you have troubles you should install the Debug version.

On 32bit Windows
=================
1. Copy siptapi.tsp from 32bit folder into your Windows system32 directory 
   (usually C:\Windows\System32)
2. Install and configure SIPTAPI using the telephony options from control panel

On 64bit Windows
=================
1. Copy siptapi.tsp from 64bit folder into your Windows system32 directory 
   (usually C:\Windows\System32). This gives you full TAPI support with 64 and 32bit
   TAPI applications
   Note: You MUST copy the siptapi.tsp file with a 64bit application. If you use a 32bit
   application, Windows will transparently map the system32 folder to SysWOW64 (32bit 
   compatibility for 64bit Windows). Therefore, the following method is preferred:
   1. Unzip the siptapi.tsp file on your Desktop
   2. Use Windows-Explorer to move the siptapi.tsp file from your Desktop to c:\Windows\system32
2. Install and configure SIPTAPI using the telephony options from control panel

NOTE:
=====
Usually, starting with Windows Vista and above, you must configure SIPTAPI as Administrator via
the control panel - otherwise you do not have proper rights.
