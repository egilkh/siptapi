This is SIPTAPI, developed by Klaus Darilion (enum.at).

The work is based on asttapi, a TAPI driver which connects to Asterisk via the manager interface (a telnet connection into Asterisk).

I removed all the asterisk/telnet related stuff and replaced it with eXosip2.

Build instructions (windows xp, visual studio.net):
- Get the osip2 and eXosip2 sources and build them:
  If you use it with Cisco phones, you have to 
  build with option: -DCISCO_BUG 
  http://www.atosc.org/pipermail/public/osip/2005-April/005130.html
  I used an early version of exosip2. Maybe the API has changed a little bit, Then you will have to update the exosip function calls in siptapi.
- Open the siptapi project: asttapi.sln
- Specify the location of the osip/exosip header fiels and libraries in the siptapi project
- build the siptapi

Installation:
- copy the siptapi.tsp file into \windows\system32\
- Start -> ControlPanel -> PhoneAndModemOptions -> Advanced -> Add -> SIP TAPI Service Provider
- SIP TAPI Service Provider -> Configure:
  configure your username, password, SIP domain and outboundproxy
