- added "reverse-mode": normally SIPTAPI calls the user's phone and then refers 
  it to the real target. In reverse mode SIPTAPI will call directly the target, 
  and once the target answers, it gets refered to the user's phone.
  Note: In reverse mode you wont get any audible call progress indication (e.g. ringback, busy tone ...)
