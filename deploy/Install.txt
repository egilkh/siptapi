A short SIPTAPI installation tutorial .....

There are 2 versions available: Release and Debug. From functionality point 
of view they are ocmpletely identical, except that the Debug version writes
log messages to the file c:\siptapi_0.2.log and sends kernel log messages 
which can be read for eaxmple with DebugView)

If you have troubles you should install the Debug version.

On 32bit Windows
=================
1. Copy siptapi.tsp from 32bit folder into your Windows system32 directory 
   (usually C:\Windows\System32)
2. Install and configure SIPTAPI using the telephony options from control panel

On 64bit Windows
=================
1. Copy siptapi.tsp from 64bit folder into your Windows system32 directory 
   (usually C:\Windows\System32). This gives you full TAPI support with 64 and 32bit
   TAPI applications
2. If you want to configure SIPTAPI not only from the telephony control panel and from
   64bit applications, but also from 32bit applications, copy the 32bit siptapi.tsp from 
   32bit folder into your WoW64 directory (usually C:\Windows\SysWow64)
3. Install and configure SIPTAPI using the telephony options from control panel

NOTE:
=====
Usually, starting with Windows Vista and above, you must configure SIPTAPI as Administrator via
the control panel - otherwise you do not have proper rights.

Troubleshooting
===============
